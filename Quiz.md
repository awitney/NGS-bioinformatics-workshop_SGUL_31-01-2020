## Quiz
1. In the VEP annotation results table, find the genomic coordinates of the missense variant with the highest Polyphen score.
2. Download the annotated vcf file using the VCF download button on the upper-right corner
3. Get the genomic position of the variant you selected in question 1 and extract this variant’s information from the vcf file (using the grep command) and save it into a new file (using the > symbol).
