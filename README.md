## Next Generation Sequencing data analysis workshop
This hands-on beginners workshop, led by Dr Alan Pittman and Dionysios Grigoriadis, 
will cover the fundamental steps of analysing next-generation sequencing data; 
from processing, quality control and aligning raw sequence data to calling SNVs 
(short germline variants (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms & short Indels) to obtain 
a reliable set of called variants for genetic analysis.  

Specifically:
-	Analysis of the human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as an example.
-	Genome reference download and index.
-	Raw reads pre-processing and quality control.
-	Reads alignment to reference genome.
-	Alignment quality control and refinement.
-	Variant Calling and Filtration.
-	Annotation of the called variants.
-	Visualisation of alignments and called variants.
